# Drive System
### Overview
Goliath uses a single 30 Hp engine and a belt system to transfer power to the four propellers. A single motor was chosen over four smaller engines because of the larger power to weight ratio than a single larger engine. High Torque Drive (HTD) belts were selected because they are able to transfer more power per weight than roller chain and can also run at higher RPMs that Goliath requires.
