The files contained in this directory are for building the rotors used for the Goliath Quadcopter. Goliath uses four rotors with two rotating clockwise (CW) and two counter-clockwise (CCW). For each rotor there are two STL files, the first one, the milled shape and the second is the final rotor shape.
Each rotor is machined out of a 38" x 10" x 1.75" foam block.  The top is machined first. Starting with a roughing pass.  Then two finish passes are made, one in the X direction and one in the Y direction.  The block is flipped over and machined on the other side, again with one rough pass and two finish passes.
