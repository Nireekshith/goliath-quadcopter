The files contained in this directory are for building the rotors used for the Goliath Quadcopter. Goliath uses four rotors with two rotating clockwise (CW) and two counter-clockwise (CCW). For each rotor there are two STL files, the first one, the milled shape and the second is the final rotor shape.
Each rotor is machined out of a 38" x 10" x 1.75" foam block.  The machining region is 36" x 8" x 1.75", leaving an inch extra on each of the side and no extra on the top and bottom.  The top is machined first. Starting with a roughing pass.  Then two finish passes are made, one in the X direction and one in the Y direction.  The block is flipped over and machined on the other side, again with one rough pass and two finish passes.
To machine the part double sided accurately, alignment pins are helpful.  To use the pins, the same alignment holes drilled into rotor need to be drilled into the spoil board (if possible).  Dowel rods (1/4" diameter) are used as alignment pins.

Tool bits needed are:
1/2" End Mill  (>=1.75" Long)
1/4" End Mill  (>=1.75" Long)

Machining Steps:
Start with 1/2" End Mill
Run rotor_XXX_top_rough
Switch to 1/4" End Mill
Run rotor_XXX_top_finish_x_only
Run rotor_XXX_top_finish_y_only
Run rotor_XXX_top_drill_holes
Flip Part Over.  Remount using the alignment holes and pins
Run rotor_XXX_bottom_rough (Note: roughing stays with 1/4" bit to fragile part)
Run rotor_XXX_bottom_finish_x_only
Run rotor_XXX_bottom_finish_y_only
