# Goliath Quadcopter
This repository contains the design data for the Goliath Quadcopter designed by
[McCloud Aero Corp](http://www.mccloudaero.com). The primary documentation source can be found at the
[Hackaday Project Page](https://hackaday.io/project/1230-goliath-a-gas-powered-quadcopter)

### Overview
Goliath is a prototype vehicle for developing large scale quadcopters. The design is based on a single central gas engine with a belt drive providing power to the four propellers. Control is done using control vanes placed under the propellers. Each propeller is enclosed within a duct that protects the rotors and contributes to the lift. Goliath itself will be open source with the creative commons license, and whenever possible open source components were used. It's currently a work in progress, and even when completed it's intended as a starting point for future vehicles.
